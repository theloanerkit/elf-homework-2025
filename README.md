# What?
This repo contains my (attempted) solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), a yearly collection of coding challenges written by Eric Wastl.

# Why?
I enjoy coding (strange, I know), and this gives me a place to put my code so that I can find it again in 6 months time.

# How's it going?

I haven't started yet. I started my PhD a few months ago and it has been *busy*. I have just set up my repo, so hopefully I'll get to start in the next few days.
